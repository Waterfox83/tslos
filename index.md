# The Secret Life of Sriket

Welcome Simblified listener!

If you are here, you heard the [Ep. 207: Who Took a Cookie From the Cookie Jar](https://shows.ivmpodcasts.com/show/simblified-RkZ1HPJY375OLhFt/episode/simblified-ep-207-who-took-a-cookie-from-the-cookie-jar-gw8d-I3eLYdNNfK75WKYo) and you know all about cookies. And unless you are Delhi BJP, you know that a lot of people in India need more than cookies (or [Doritos](https://twitter.com/adeshguptabjp/status/1396073619709521924)) at the moment to survive. 

Please donate to any of [these charities](https://donate.indiacovidresources.in/#organisations) or to many of the good samaritans appealing for help on social media.

As Naren would sign off: Stay Safe, [Stay Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_izvAbhExY), Stay Simblified!
