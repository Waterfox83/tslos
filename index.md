# The Secret Life of Sriket

Welcome Simblified listener!

If you are here, you heard the 3rd May episode of Simblified and you know all about cookies. And unless you are Delhi BJP, you know that a lot of people in India need more than cookies (or [Doritos](https://twitter.com/adeshguptabjp/status/1396073619709521924)) at the moment to survive. 

Please donate to any of [these charities](https://donate.indiacovidresources.in/#organisations) or to many of the good samaritans appealing for help on social media.
